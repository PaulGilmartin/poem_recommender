"I set my soul free down the dreamers lane
Thoughts of joyful times bring my mind aflight
Moons of memories drip so lovely light
Stars above hum a tune to ease my pain
I sail a sea where kings of past did reign
Thoughts buried deep burn in the stars so bright
To see the legends only I may sight
A life of imagery that pumps in vein

As life is written in a hidden page
I soar among all the things that will fly
I'm always seeking my soul's so lost core
Sooths all of my hate and my painful rage
Sorrow from all my blood dripped tears I cry

The sap has ascended my arms,
The tree has grown in my breast-

The branches grow out of me, like arms.

Tree you are,
Moss you are,
You are violets with wind above them.
A child - so high - you are,
And all this is folly to the world.
