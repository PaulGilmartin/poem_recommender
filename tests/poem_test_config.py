TEST_NON_STANDARD_FORM = """I set my soul free down the dreamers lane
Thoughts of joyful times bring my mind a flight
Moons of memories drip so lovely light
Stars above hum a tune to ease my pain
I sail a sea where kings of past did reign
Thoughts buried deep burn in the stars so bright
To see the legends only I may sight
A life of imagery that pumps in vein

As life is written in a hidden page
I soar among all the things that will fly
I'm always seeking my soul's so lost core
Sooths all of my hate and my painful rage
Sorrow from all my blood dripped tears I cry
Dreams are the peace felt in life times before"""
